    <h3 style="font-size: 15px; padding-bottom: 10px;">Milestone 4</h3>
    <p>This application simulates a network routing simulator with four routing algorithms: Random Routing Algorithm, Flooding Routing Algorithm, Breadth
	First Search Algorithm and Depth First Search Algorithm. Specifically, this application allows the user to create a network topology, step through
	simulations of these networks, and track metrics (packets transmitted and average hops) for the simulations.</p>

      > File
      <ol>
        <li>Restore: opens a dialog which allows the user to select a network topology XML file to restore to the application</li>
        <li>Save: opens a dialog which allows the user to save the current network topology of the application to an XML file</li>
        <li>Exit: exits the application</li>

      > Simulation
      <ol>
      	 <li>Step: steps the simulation, which forwards all messages at routers to their neighbours, and may generate a new message based on
      	 the message generation rate
      	 </li>
      	 <li>Undo: steps backwards in the simulation, which moves messages to their previous destination</li>
      	 <li>Message Generation Rate: opens a dialog which allows the user to set the rate at which messages are generated in the simulation</li>
      	 <li>Clear Messages: removes the messages from all routers and clears the metrics (note: you cannot step back after this)</li>
      	 <li>Routing Algorithm: opens a dialog which allows the user to select which routing algorithm to use for the simulation</li>

    <h5>Guide</h5>
    <div class="text-body">
      <p>To add a new router first click on the add button in routers, then user will then have a prompt to 
      enter a name and then will be prompted to click on the screen where the router should be added. 
      This can be repeated as many times as desired.</p>
      <p>To remove a node, click on the node, and the border will change colour to notify you that it has been selected.</p>
      <p>To create a new connection from one node to another click on one router and drag to another router.</p>
      <p>To remove a connection, click on the connection and then click on the remove connection button.</p>
	  <p>To simulate the network, go to the 'Simulation' menu in the menu bar and click 'Step'. The Routing algorithm that was last selected in the RoutingAlgorithm dialog (or RandomRoutingAlgorithm as default) 
	  will be used to simulate a step in the network.</p>
	  <p>The undo functionality will only move back messages to their previous destinations and restore the metrics to their values from the last step. This will not undo adding/removing routers/connections.
	  After restoring a network topology from an XML file, you cannot undo any stored messages/metrics that initially load (the previous messages/metrics do not get saved to XML).</p>
	  <p>After making a modification to a network topology (add/remove routers/connections) you will not be able to undo to a state earlier than the modification point. Additionally, 
	  after clearing all messages on the topology through the 'Clear Messages' menu button, you will not be able to undo to a state earlier than that point.</p>
